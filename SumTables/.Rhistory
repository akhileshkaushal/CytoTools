### 1.2 Load packages
library('flowCore')
library('plyr')
library('data.table')
library('rstudioapi')
library('R.utils')
library('tidyr')
library('Biobase')
### 1.3 - Set working directory and assign as 'PrimaryDirectory'
## In order for this to work, a) rstudioapi must be installed and b) the location of this .r script must be in your desired working directory
dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)            # Finds the directory where this script is located
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))     # Sets the working directory to where the script is located
getwd()
PrimaryDirectory <- getwd()
PrimaryDirectory
# Basis
use.groups            <- 1        # Add group keyword to output files (currently only works for cell number summaries)
# Cell numbers
do.CELLNUM            <- 1        # Calculate cell numbers per cluster/sample/file
do.CELLPROPORTIONS    <- 1        # Calculate cell proprotions per cluster/sample/file
do.CELLSPERTISSUE     <- 1        # Calculate cell numbers per cluster/sample/tissue        # Turn OFF if you don't have any cell counts
do.FOLDCHANGE         <- 1        # Calculate cell number/proportion changes as fold-change         # Turn OFF if you don't have group keywords
