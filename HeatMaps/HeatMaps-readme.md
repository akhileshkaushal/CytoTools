# CytoTools/HeatMaps

Thomas Myles Ashhurst, Sydney Cytometry Facility

The HeatMaps script can be used to generate raw or fold-change value heatmaps from a set of data. The script reads input from a CSV file, and generates a heatmap PDF. Various settings can be modified to change the nature or appearance of the heatmap.
